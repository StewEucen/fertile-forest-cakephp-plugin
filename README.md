# Fertile Forest Model for Plugin of CakePHP 3.x

[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.txt)

This plugin is an implementation of the Fertile Forest Model for CakePHP 3.x.

## What's Fertile Forest Model?

We know four models for storing hierarchical data in a database.

1. Adjacency List Model
2. Path Emuneration Model
3. Nested Sets Model (Nested Intervals Model)
4. Closure Table Model

Fertile Forest Model (= FF Model) is the fifth Model for storing hierarchical data in database. Stew Eucen who is Japanese database engineer discovered it. FF Model has some excellent features than each conventional model.

Many libraries of framework use "Nested Sets Model" for storing hierarchical data in RDB. However, we got the new model now. I think that Nested Sets Model will be replaced by FF Model in Future. My plan is that CakePHP 4.x contains ForestBehavior.
